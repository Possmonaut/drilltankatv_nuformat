/*
this has been modified from it's children, so you will need to update them all
if making one of these persistent, will need to make it so that it will detecy more of itself in create,
	and if so, kill self and exit
	then persistence cna be used to check if rooms have been moved between for counters and such 
probably change the below to a ds_grid so that it can read off multiple lines IF needed, then write dif lines when the player comes back
