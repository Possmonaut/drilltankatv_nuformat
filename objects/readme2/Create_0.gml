//adjust blocks and blockgrid offset 8 or so pixels from the tiles so the player has a bit of a buffer
//between top and bottom. easier solution than changing every tile

//either complete extended rectangle collider behavior or use  new sprite guide sprite201 (bottom) 
//presumably you can use a extended rectangle collider, but you need to add in the angle rotation code from the 
//drill collider 

//add that thing that will keep players from blacking out while within blocks (if inside block, remove shadow tile)

//drill should be above block while wheels and sprite should be beneath 

//fix the drill collision!
